# Introduction

Welcome to the Dimention API documentation.

For now, the API is located at the AWS Elastic Beanstalk url:

`http://dimention-env-vd3evffjxi.elasticbeanstalk.com`

The API is located at `/api` and is versioned (`/api/v1`, etc). Because there is only one version at the moment, this means you should access all API calls at the following URL:

`http://dimention-env-vd3evffjxi.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/v1`

In the documentation below, this URL will be abbreviated as:

`...api/v1/some_route`

# Authentication

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

The API expects for the auth token to be included in most API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: TOKEN`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>TOKEN</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Users

## Get All Users

curl "...api/v1/users"
